# Abstract


The proposed project is aim to design a microstrip antenna for the detection of adulteration in milk. A microstrip antenna resonating at frequency of 838MHz is designed. A inset feed technique is used for feeding the microstrip antenna. The microstrip antenna is miniaturized and optimized by using miniaturization techniqes
namely meandering of patch and shorting of the patch with ground plane. The microstrip antenna is used as a sensor rather than for communication purpose. The non-adulterated milk sample which is placed on the radiating patch makes the microstrip antenna sensor to radiate at a specific resonant frequency i.e. at 838MHz. When the non-adulterated milk sample is replaced by adulterated milk sample the resonant frequency of antenna is shifted from 838MHz. The resonant frequency of the microstrip antenna sensor is inversely proportional to the dielectric constant or permittivity of the sample placed on it. Thus from the resonant frequency
of the microstrip antenna it is detected whether the milk sample is adulterated or not.
